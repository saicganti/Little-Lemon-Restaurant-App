            <p> We are a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant in Chicago. It all started <br></br>when two immigrant
                brothers from Italy wanted people here <br></br> to get a taste of authentic Mediterranean food. We
                focus on <br></br>traditional recipes served with a modern twist.<br></br><br></br> Our address: 123
                Maledove St, Chicago, IL 60007</p>
